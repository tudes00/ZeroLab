# Micro-CMS v1 - Hacker101 CTF Writeup

**Challenge Link:** [Micro-CMS v1 @ Hacker101](https://ctf.hacker101.com/ctf)  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Category:** Web  
**Platform:** Hacker101


## 1. Recon

Open the challenge in your browser and explore the available pages. There are a couple of pre-existing pages you can view and a button to create a new page. The website as no css, it looks really bad...

Click into the **Markdown Test** page to see how content is rendered.

The editor indicates Markdown support and shows an edit button. Try editing to see how input is handled.

## 2. Flag 1

It say that script are not supported,  but lets try it anyway, so we add a simple xss vulnerability on the title and the description and save it:

```html
<script>alert("XSS")</script>
```
It seem like the script is not executed but lets go in the home page, maybe its executed there.
And here we go, the script is executed, so we have a XSS vulnerability.

## 3. Flag 2

The `<script>` tag was blocked or not executed in the description, so try a different vector that often bypasses naive filters: an image tag with an `onerror` handler.

Insert into the description:

```html
<img src=x onerror="alert('XSS')">
```

Save it and, Here we go, xss vulnerability!

But no flag appear, let try to find it in another place like console or inspector. Inspecting the page with the browser inspector revealed the flag!

## 4. Flag 3
While creating pages, notice the URL pattern when viewing pages ends with an index:

```
/page/0
/page/1
/page/2
/page/3
```

Trying `/page/4` returned a **403 Forbidden** error.

However, direct editing URL access remained possible. Visiting the edit route for that ID:

```
/page/edit/4
```

allowed viewing the page content (because the edit route did not enforce the same access control). The third flag was present on that edit page.

## 5. Flag 4
When you edit a page, you can see that the URL is like this : `http://[some random character].ctf.hacker101.com/edit/1`, Let try a SQL injection

I try to add a `'` at the end of the URL like this : `http://[some random character].ctf.hacker101.com/edit/1'` 
And boom, the second flag is here!

## 6. Tips

* When you suspect XSS, test multiple vectors: `<script>`, inline event handlers (e.g., `onerror`), SVG, `javascript:` URLs, etc.
* Always inspect the DOM and network requests â€” flags or secrets are often placed in hidden elements or comments.
* Enumerate sequential resources (`/page/0`, `/page/1`, ...) and check both view and admin/edit endpoints for inconsistent access control.
* Try small URL tampering tests (add quotes, comments, or boolean logic) to see whether input flows into a query or error page.

## 7. Conclusion

GG! ðŸŽ‰ You did it, Micro-CMS v1 completed!
